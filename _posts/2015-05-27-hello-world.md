title: Hello, World?
---

Hello, World!  I've spent so much time attempting to figure out how to create this blog and I've finally decided to start
hacking together something that I can display to the rest of you.  Ranging from serving a simple single page web site to wondering if I should be using Wordpress to serve these posts, I have spent the past year learning, putting together
the pieces, and developing various projects in order to display my passion for web development.  It's been quite a ride
and here I am, at my temporary resting place of a blog.

Let's take a look at the inner workings of this piece, shall we?

The blog itself is built with Jekyll served via [Poole](www.getpoole.com) (created by the great [@mdo](markdotto.com)).
The CSS is complied from Jekyll as well but I plan on expanding it to use [Bourbon, Neat and Bitters](http://bourbon.io/) when the site itself gets larger.  Further plans include adding [Masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/) to display my projects in a landing page format, eventually hiding my rambles within the blog behind it.  While I brush up on JavaScript and jQuery, you'll see some added elements from those two as well.

The font is the simple Google Font Roboto, I prefer the simple almost elegant thin type.  Next up is the formation of the stylesheet and possibly a separate Github repo concerning that.

The blog will follow my journey as I create more for this website and this blog post in particular will become a colophon.

Until now enjoy my musings and hopefully we'll cross paths soon.
