title: Hello, World?
---

Hello, World.  I've spent so much time attempting to figure out how to create this blog and I've finally decided to start
hacking together something that I can display to the rest of you.  I've spent the past year learning, putting together
the pieces, and developing various projects in order to display my passion for web development.  It's been quite a ride
and here I am, at my temporary resting place of a blog.

Let's take a look at the inner workings of this piece, shall we?

The blog itself is built with Jekyll served via [Poole](www.getpoole.com) (created by the great [@mdo](markdotto.com)).
The CSS is complied from Jekyll as well but I plan on expanding it to use Bourbon, Neat and Bitters when the site itself
gets larger.  Further plans include adding Masonry.js to display my projects in a landing page format, eventually hiding
my rambles within the blog behind it.  While I brush up on JavaScript and *GASP* jQuery, you'll see some added elements
from those two as well.

The blog will follow my journey as I create more for this website and this blog post in particular will become a 
colophon.  Until now enjoy my musings and hopefully we'll cross paths soon.
